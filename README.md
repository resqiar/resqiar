# Who Am I?
I am Resqi Ageng Rahmatullah, just call me **RES**, a Software Engineer specializing in fullstack software development. I thrive on embracing new technologies to stay at the forefront of industry advancements. In front-end development, I do things in JS/TS, including either framework or meta-framework like Astro, Svelte, NextJS and Sveltekit. 
In the backend, I am proficient in either big-bone-framework like NestJS with Fastify/Express or just use a simple tools like Golang. **My expertise spans multiple languages and tools within the modern web ecosystem**. Programming languages are tools, and what truly sets me apart is my determination to adapt and learn.

### [Algo-V](https://github.com/resqiar/algo-visualization) — `released`
Algo-V is a visualization tool that I developed to help me better understand the algorithms that I learned. Developing this app has greatly enhanced my understanding, as it goes beyond mere theoretical memorization by allowing me to implement and animate the algorithms directly within the browser.

### [Binder](https://github.com/resqiar/binder) — `released`
To effectively store the supporting information from my binder/notebook, I developed Binder, my personal application.
The app was built with the stunning tool, Svelte. It is not only a web application, but it also includes a server (NestJS and Fastify) and a mobile component (React Native) for increased convenience and accessibility. Even though it is personal, it can be extended to public usage at any point since it is designed to easily extended for future use-case.
